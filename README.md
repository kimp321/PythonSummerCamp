# PythonSummerCamp

This is a 3 month bootcamp I hosted to learn Python and Data Science.

As a study group, we met once a week to study the following topics:
- Python Coding, data types and data structures
- Data Manipulation, using NumPy and Pandas
- Data Visualization, using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Data Modeling, thinking through solutions to real problems

At the end of the program, we completed and discussed a final project using real data.
